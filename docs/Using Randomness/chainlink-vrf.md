Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably fair and verifiable random number generator (RNG) that enables smart contracts to access random values without compromising security or usability.

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Supported networks](#supported-networks)

## Overview

For each request, Chainlink VRF generates one or more random values and cryptographic proof of how those values were determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before any consuming applications can use it. This process ensures that results cannot be tampered with or manipulated by any single entity including oracle operators, miners, users, or smart contract developers.

Use Chainlink VRF to build reliable smart contracts for any applications that rely on unpredictable outcomes:

- Building blockchain games and NFTs.
- Random assignment of duties and resources. For example, randomly assigning judges to cases.
- Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms.
